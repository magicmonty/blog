another Version with new features is out.

<span class="more"></span>

Changes:

* now it’s possible to have read-only groups.
* the english language is set as default
* refactored some functions for better readability
* it’s now possible to use the internal groups from MediaWiki

There are some thing to to for the next version::

* Restrict search/RSS results for protected pages (without pathich if possible)
* the use of multiple accesscontrol-tags for use in templates
* the additional use of single users
* the accesscontrol-tag has to be on the first line of the wikitext to work correctly, that has to be fixed
