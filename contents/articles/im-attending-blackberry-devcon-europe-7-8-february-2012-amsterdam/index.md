BlackBerry® DevCon Europe is the premier developer event where BlackBerry® enthusiasts will come together for sessions, demonstrations, keynotes, and more — all focused on creating mobile applications for the powerful BlackBerry platform.

I’ll be attending! Join me so you can also get the value from the conference content, including previews and demonstrations of the latest innovations and breakthroughs with BlackBerry technology. I’m looking forward to discovering tools that can help me make apps more profitable, technologies that lead to developing more engaging Super Apps, and hot topics such as the BBM™ Social Platform, BlackBerry® 7, Adobe®Flash® and Adobe® AIR®, BlackBerry® WebWorks™, and more.

I hope to see you there. Find out more about the conference at http://www.blackberrydevcon.com/europe.
